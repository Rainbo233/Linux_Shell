# Linux_Shell
Shell completed for my CST-315 class at GCU

My role in creating this shell was to do most if not all the coding. This shell is very simple, but capable of replicating most of the basic commands that linux shells
can do already, like make and delete files, clone files and directories, edit files, etc.
